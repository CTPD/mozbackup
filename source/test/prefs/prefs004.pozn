I have a problem using MozBackup, and after looking at the MozBackup support forum, I realised that you would need the following information to help me out. So I'm hoping that you will take a look.

This is the path to my Thunderbird profile:
C:\Documents and Settings\Kristian\Application Data\Thunderbird\Profiles\mj5nfcig.default

These are the errors I get when trying to backup using MozBackup:
Problem with backup email account! Account: C:\Documents and Settings\Kristian\Application Data\Thunderbird\Profiles\sp6sum9n.default\Mail\Local Folders
Problem with backup email account! Account: C:\Documents and Settings\Kristian\Application Data\Thunderbird\Profiles\sp6sum9n.default\Mail\pop3.mail.dk

I have attached my prefs-file.

Sincerely, Kristian Troelsen
